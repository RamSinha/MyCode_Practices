1- All the systems can be considered as box.
2- Box in which we store data and query data from.


                ----------------
                |              | 
                |              |
                |     System   |
                |      Box     |
                |              |
                |              |
                |              |
                ----------------




This naturally opens up some questions:
1- Who will write data
2- Who will read data
3- How much data will be written.  [volumne]
4- How fast data will be written. [write query per second] [what is tail latency ? p99]
5- How fast data is EXPECTED to be written [speed]
6- How much data will be queried [point in time, last 1 year data] [volume]
7- How fast data will be queried.[read query per second]
8- How fast data is EXPECTED to be retrieved [speed] [what is tail latency ? p99]
9- Cost?



Functional Requirements:
1- What action the system is supposed to take?
2- How whould it look like if it was just a method ? change the method to API..
   Think about what will be input to these method? this eventually will become query param of API..


Non Functional Requirements:
1- Performance
2- Scalability
3- Availability
4- Correct/ Reliable
