1- Optimal substructure:
    1) Apply the cut-and-paste approach => Pick some choice and assume its optimum, then prove that this optimum choice exhibit to optimum solution to sub-problems.

    2) Make sure that solution to each sub-problem for A GIVEN problem is independent, i.e  optimum solution to one sub-problem doesn't impact or restrict the optimum solution to other sub-problem.

2- Overlapping sub-problems:
    1) DP is applicable when-> Optimus choices lead to overlapping sub-problems, If at each step new problem is generated then its not useful than any other technique (example: Divide and Conquer algorithms generate non-overlapping subproblems)

Can be considered as depth-first-search of sub-problem graph

2- Bottom-up approach:
   1) Applies when there is natural order in the solution of sub-problems. For ex: m[2,4] => only depends on sub-problem m[2,2], m[2,3], m[3,4].
   2) Bottom-up approach works well in most of the case since there is less procedural calls however in case of top-down approach at-times one may skip entire sub-problem based on some-condition. ex: LCS
      Top down approach solves problems which are definitely required hence it may led to faster runtime when there are conditional statement in deciding subproblems.

Can be considered as topological-sort of sub-problem graph

Runtime:
Depends on two important factors:
1- Number of sub-problems (DISTINCT)
2- Number of choices available for each problems

For rod cutting:
   1) O(n)
   2) n
   hence overall runtime was O(n^2)

For metrix multiplication:
   1) O(n^2)
   2) n
   hence overall runtime was O(n^3)


# Usually sufficient for solving two dimentional dynamic programming problem
    for l in range(2,n+1):
        for i in range(0,n-l+1):
            j=i+l-1


NOTE: At every choice in the search space- we need to perform below three things.
1- Make sure the property of problem holds (ex: total weight of selected items shall not exceed kanpsack size)
2- Apply the objective function.
3- Calculate cost using obj function and store the result


NOTE-2:
1- In many cases the recursive problem [sub-problem] requires historical info like how did we reach to a particular subproblem.. in cases like these its important to modify the problem to include additional history information,
ex: For scheduling problem, we added information about initial inventory and whether the machine was on/off previous day.
